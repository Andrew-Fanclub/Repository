Main Repo for the stuffs

Keep in mind look at the different Readme I made called AFCReadme.md

Side note for storage space shit: instead storing images locally in server we GET src url itself and put it into <img> so we can keep it all on one server

ex: <img src ="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/46b07b5e-1264-42e1-ae4b-8a021226e2d0/domestic-cat_thumb_square.jpg" alt='cat' />
